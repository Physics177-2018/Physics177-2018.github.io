## Physics 177: Computational Physics

[Course webpage](https://physics177-2018.github.io/) (this page)  
[Syllabus](https://github.com/Physics177-2018/Syllabus)

If you are taking this class, you already have a solid grasp of 'pen and paper' physics. Modern physics, however, often requires tools beyond 'pen and paper' in two ways:
1. Large data sets that can require sophisticated processing and analysis.  
2. Intractable calculations, for example nonlinear systems or high-dimensional phase spaces.  

This is a crash course in learning to deal with data in physical systems and numerical solutions of problems using computers. This is neither a computer science course on algorithms nor a data-based lab course, but it is somewhere in between.

## Week 1

This week we settled into the class. Some students are having trouble with registering, so if you're not yet registered, please don't wait until the last minute in case there are problems. (There's something weird going on with the course registration system.)

**[Lecture 1](https://github.com/Physics177-2018/Lecture_01)**: A soft introduction to the class. Why does "computational physics" exist, anyway? Is it different from "real physics"? The Golden Rule for this class: *Professor Tanedo regrets cannot help you with technical computer problems*. Please make time to get your system up and running---but once you're in a Jupyter notebook, it should be smooth sailing. Index card: name / SID / year / programming background / anything I should know about you.

**[Lecture 2](https://github.com/Physics177-2018/Lecture_02)**: Using GitHub. By the way, here's an [example for how to best look for resources online](http://bfy.tw/DYY6). The discussion on rounding error roughly follows the [Python 3 Tutorial, section 15](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html). More on representation of numbers: 
- [What Every Programmer Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic](http://floating-point-gui.de/)
- [You're Going To Have To Think!](https://accu.org/index.php/journals/1702)
- [Floating Point Representation and Rounding Error (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbxSTxhTmrs)

## Week 2

**[Lecture 3](https://github.com/Physics177-2018/Lecture_03)**: Basic integration using Riemann sums, installing packages. 

**[Lecture 4](https://github.com/Physics177-2018/Lecture_04)**: Integration with trapezoids and parabolas.

## Week 3

*Note: there is NO CLASS on Tuesday, April 17. Homework is still due!*
